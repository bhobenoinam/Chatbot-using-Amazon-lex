Building A ChatBot With Amazon Lex: A Chatbots is an intelligent software that can simulate a conversation (or a chat) with a user in natural language through messaging applications, websites, mobile phones or telephone. They can be programmed to respond to simple keywords or prompts to complex conversations. A Chatbot has two different tasks at the core: user request analysis (identifying the intent of the user) and returning the response. There are two types of chatbots: one functions on a set of rules and the other more advanced one uses artificial intelligence. 1. Chatbots that function on rules: It is easy to build. Though simplistic, it can get basics tasks done with limitations to specific commands. This bot is only as smart as it is programmed. 2. Chatbots that function on machine learning: It understands languages and not just commands and provides relevant responses. It communicates through speech or text relying on AI technologies like machine learning and NLP. It gets smarter as it learns from the conversations from users.
